# Twig Basic Layout

This project uses MIT-LICENSE so mess around and use it if you want and credit where it's due.

## Install

Use it in the gem file:

```ruby
gem 'twig_layout', git: "https://github.com/chriswnl/twig-layout.git"
```

Then run the install command. This will copy twig.html.erb to your layouts folder and application.scss, 
variables and mixins to assets.

```console
rails generate twig_layout:install
```

That's it for now.
