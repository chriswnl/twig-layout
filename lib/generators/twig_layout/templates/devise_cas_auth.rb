  # The CAS specification allows for the passing of a follow URL to be displayed when
  # a user logs out on the CAS server. RubyCAS-Server also supports redirecting to a
  # URL via the destination param. Set either of these urls and specify either nil,
  # 'destination' or 'follow' as the logout_url_param. If the urls are blank but
  # logout_url_param is set, a default will be detected for the service.
  # config.cas_destination_url = 'https://cas.myorganization.com'
  # config.cas_follow_url = 'https://cas.myorganization.com'
  # config.cas_logout_url_param = nil

  # You can specify the name of the destination argument with the following option.
  # e.g. the following option will change it from 'destination' to 'url'
  # config.cas_destination_logout_param_name = 'url'

  # By default, devise_cas_authenticatable will create users.  If you would rather
  # require user records to already exist locally before they can authenticate via
  # CAS, uncomment the following line.
  # config.cas_create_user = false

  # You can enable Single Sign Out, which by default is disabled.

  # identifier, but some other field passed in cas_extra_attributes, you can specify
  # the field name here.
  # config.cas_user_identifier = nil
  config.cas_user_identifier = 'email'
  config.cas_username_column = "email"

  # If you want to use the Devise Timeoutable module with single sign out,
  # uncommenting this will redirect timeouts to the logout url, so that the CAS can
  # take care of signing out the other serviced applocations. Note that each
  # application manages timeouts independently, so one application timing out will
  # kill the session on all applications serviced by the CAS.

  # If you need to specify some extra configs for rubycas-client, you can do this via:
  # config.cas_client_config_options = {
  #     logger: Rails.logger
  # }
